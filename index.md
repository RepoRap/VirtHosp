# Virtual Hospital Project 
# An Hospital Service Integration and testing platform
### Testing equipment and service allocations in real time based several available parameters and fine tuning of optimizations
This project is about allowing contributors and innovators to implement their solutions on vitrual patients and see the effectivity of solution on the patient virtually. As it is a starter project, THis year we are aiming to simulate exact solutions for handling coronavirus and implement solutions in avirtual environement based on dat astatistics and provide solutions from broader spectrum to carter solutions to hospitals and innovators to try and test out the hospital emulator based on patient population and contagious score. In order to assimilate this simulation there is a dire need of the following people in the project. PLease click the google link and apply so that we can accomodate the people in appropriate groups and monitor the progress of the project as part of our efforts.
